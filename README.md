# Code of Conduct

## Summary

This repository contains the conduct guide for the [Spring 2022 semester offering of CMPSC 203, Software Engineering](https://mariakimheinert.com/software-engineering/course-syllabus/). The instructor and students will use this conduct guide to govern all course interactions.

## Improving the Conduct Guide

During the Spring 2022 semester, you will work collaboratively to design, implement, test, document, and deploy sustainable software. As you complete tasks to create this software, and as you participate in other course activities, you are responsible for adhering to this conduct guide as well as any other team contracts that emerge.

A template for the conduct guide has been provided in `conduct.md`. For this laboratory assignment, please use [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) to collaboratively complete the conduct guide. In the conduct guide, you should describe the student and instructor behaviors that are acceptable and unacceptable in the context of this course. Students are invited to review the [Codes of Values from MIT's Course on Product Engineering Processes](https://web.mit.edu/2.009/www/team_manual/code_of_values.html). Make sure that the conduct guide explains how infractions will be handled.
